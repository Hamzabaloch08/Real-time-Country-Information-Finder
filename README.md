# Real-time Country Information Finder

## Features

- **Real-time Search**: As the user types a country name, relevant information is displayed instantly.
- **Country Information**: Displays the country's flag, capital, population, borders, and languages.
- **Error Handling**: Provides error messages when the country is not found or there are network issues.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.
